Techlagon is a website I created with a variety of programs that solve equations 

The calculus page (https://techlagon.netlify.app/calc) solves Derivative and Integral operations. It allows you to customize the variable used, by default it is X 

  The Geometry Page (https://techlagon.netlify.app/geometry) is a versatile tool designed to solve various geometry equations. It features calculators for perimeter, area, the Pythagorean theorem, trigonometric functions, and coordinate geometry.
The Perimeter and Area calculators allow you to input the required dimensions, such as length, to instantly compute your results.
The Pythagorean Theorem calculator provides fields for both Side A and Side B, enabling you to input the known variables and find the missing side.
The Trigonometric Functions calculator includes placeholders where you can enter angle and side values to perform trigonometric calculations.
For Coordinate Geometry, the calculator presents four input fields for the required variables, making it easy to compute equations related to points, lines, and more.
This intuitive interface ensures quick and accurate solutions for all your geometry needs.

The Algebra page allows
